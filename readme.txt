This project is about obituaries and how we remember people. 
Obituaries are a primary way Ancestry and other large genealogy/heritage companies produce information about nongovernmental aspects of people's lives.
/src is where the primary scraping, data preprocessing, and labeling code is
/data is where the auxiliary data lives (the obituaries themselves are somewhere else)
/notebooks is where the data analysis and visualization notebooks are
